In this Question, I have implemented gradient ascent algorithm with hinge loss.

For my results I have used c =10 and epsilone = 0.0001 as mentioned in assignment.

This file will give result for both linear and quadratic kernel.
It also display the alpha metrix for both and weight metrix with offset b values.

Alpha values for linear kernel is stored in linear-kernel.txt and Homogeneous Qudratic kernel in quadratic-kernel.txt.
Eqation for both kernels are stored in equations.txt.
